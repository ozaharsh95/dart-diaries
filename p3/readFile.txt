Hello Good Morning.
This is a very beautiful butterfly.
See you later guys.

In the heart of the whispering woods,
Where tall trees stand as they should,
Leaves rustle soft, the wind hums low,
Tales of the forest begin to flow.

A brook dances over rocks and stones,
Singing sweet tunes in gentle tones,
Beneath the sky so deep and wide,
In this quiet place, peace abides.

The sun peeks through in golden streams,
Painting the world in gentle beams,
Squirrels scurry, birds take flight,
All under the morning light.

Flowers bloom in colors bright,
Bees buzz by with pure delight,
In every corner, life is found,
In every tree, on every mound.

The woods hold secrets, old and true,
Of skies so gray and skies so blue,
And if you listen, still and clear,
The heart of nature you might hear.

So if you wander, far or near,
Find a spot and settle here,
In the woods where magic lies,
Beneath the earth, under skies.
